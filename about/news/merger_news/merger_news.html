    <h2>Merger news</h2>
<h3 align="RIGHT">1 May 1998</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
A new King's College London is being created from two mergers which will secure the College's place in the premier league of higher education institutions.
</p>
<p>
The Institute of Psychiatry merged with King's on 1 August 1997 and the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals (UMDS) merges with King's on 1 August 1998.
</p>
<p>
The mergers will confirm the new King's as a lead player in research and teaching on both the national and international stage:  a multi-faculty, research-led teaching institution with three major campuses in the heart of London and a unique suite of provision in subjects allied to medicine.
</p>
<p>
King's will remain one of the University of London's two largest colleges, with some 16,500 students.  The new College will be one of the country's top five higher education institutions for research earnings and will have nine subject-areas achieving the top rating of 5* in the most recent Research Assessment Exercise, making it a major player in terms of international excellence.
</p>
<p>
The new King's will retain the current College's excellence in education, humanities and law, its diversity of provision in the life sciences and its distinguished tradition in natural sciences and engineering, and will bring together three of Britain's most famous medical and dental names - Guy's, King's and St Thomas' - to form one of the largest medical and dental schools in Europe.  Strengths in biological sciences, clinical medicine and dentistry, and psychiatry, combined with an exceptionally broad spectrum of subjects allied to medicine (including nursing &amp; midwifery, nutrition &amp; dietetics, physiotherapy and gerontology) will provide the merged College with a unique resource for teaching and research.
