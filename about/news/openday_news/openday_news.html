    <h2>King's annual Open Day</h2>

<p>
If you came to King's on 23 April 1998 you are likely to have been one of the 2,500+ potential university applicants, parents or teachers who took advantage of our Open Day to find out about the College. After an initial surge at the Registration points, visitors dispersed throughout King's to attend a range of sessions including talks on particular courses, details about accommodation, advice on applying to university, tours of King's and coach tours of London.
</p>

<h3>Any other questions?</h3>
<p>
You may find that having visited the College, you have further questions. If so, check the prospectus you received when you arrived for the contact details of staff. Most of our Admissions Tutors have e-mail addresses - where relevant these will also be found in the prospectus.
</p>

<h3>Your comments</h3>
<p>
Your feedback will help us plan similar events for potential applicants. Lured by a prize draw, many visitors completed questionnaires. The winner of the draw will be advised as soon as possible after 5 May. If you didn't fill in a questionnaire and would like to make any comments about your visit to King's, then e-mail the Schools &amp; Colleges Liaison Service (jes.wilcox@kcl.ac.uk).
</p>
