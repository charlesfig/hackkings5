    <h2>Up to £1,000  a year bursaries for students from South East Asia</h2>

  <h3 align="RIGHT">27 March 1998</h3>


  <p>
  Bursaries of £750 a year are being offered to students from some countries of South East Asia who have received an offer to study for a degree at King's College London.  Bursaries of £1,000 a year are available to existing students from these countries returning to study at King's.
  </p>

  <p>
  The bursaries are intended to assist students from <b>Indonesia</b>, <b>Malaysia</b>, <b>Philippines</b>, <b>South Korea</b> and <b>Thailand</b> who have been hit by the fall in value of their currencies.  Applicants from these countries who have been offered a place to study at King's College London in September this year can apply for a bursary of £750 a year from the College which will help to cover the cost of living in London. There are also deferred payment schemes for students from <b>Brunei</b>, <b>Singapore</b> and <b>Taiwan</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
  As an alternative to the bursary, students may opt for a package which offers fees fixed at the 1998/9 level (for up to three years);  makes it possible to defer payment of part of the fees;  spreads payments out through the year, and allows a refund if a student has to withdraw before the end of the first term. In addition to the £1000 bursary, continuing students will also benefit from fixed fees and payment by installments.
  </p>

  <p>
  There will be no means test: the bursary or other package is available to all students from these countries who accept an offer of a place to study for a degree at King's College London starting in September.  The King's College London bursary may also be held in addition to any assistance received from other bodies.  A separate package of assistance which holds down fee levels and offers deferred payments is being made available to students from <b>Brunei</b>, <b>Singapore</b> and <b>Taiwan</b>, which have suffered less heavy falls in value in their currency.  There are currently nearly 600 students from South East Asia studying at King's.
  </p>

  <p>
  Professor Arthur Lucas, Principal of King's College London, said: 'We greatly value the contribution students from South East Asia make to life at King's.  We have a commitment to our relationship with these countries, and we  want to enable the tradition of such students coming to King's College London to continue unbroken.  I hope these bursaries and other packages will offer useful assistance to students hard-hit by the fall in value of their currencies.'
  </p>

  <p>
  All candidates from these countries still holding offers from the College and students who are already at the College will be written to personally informing them of the offer.
  </p>

  <p>
  In the case of publicly funded students, King's will extend financial aid to their sponsoring bodies.
