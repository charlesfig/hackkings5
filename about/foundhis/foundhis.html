<p>
King's College London is the second largest School of the University of London. It was founded by Royal Charter in 1829, with the support of King George IV and the Duke of Wellington, by a distinguished group of patrons - ecclesiastical and secular - who wished to promote a university education which encompassed both traditional and modern studies but was less radically secular than the institution that is now University College.
</p>

<p>
King's was established next to Somerset House on land granted in perpetuity by the Crown, and this Strand campus is still the College's main site, in the heart of London, close to the seat of Government, the City, the Royal Courts of Justice and the Inns of Court.
</p>

<p>
The work of the College opened in the session 1831-32. For a period of 70 years from its foundation the College provided instruction for young people of various ages and attainments in a Junior Department (now King's College School, Wimbledon), and in faculties of Arts, Laws, Natural Science, Medical Science, Engineering and Theology. Among the famous people who established the College's strong academic tradition in the nineteenth century were scientists Sir Charles Wheatstone, James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Lister. At the same time King's has always been at the forefront of new academic developments: it was among the first to provide education for women and to offer evening classes, and it was a pioneer of modular degrees.
</p>

<p>
By the King's College London (Transfer) Act, 1908, King's College School, the Strand School and King's College Hospital Medical School became completely independent of the parent body; the College Council retained responsibility only for government of the Theological Department, whilst remaining faculties of the College and the Women's Department were incorporated in the newly reconstituted University of London; the Household and Social Science Department became a separate college in 1928 - since 1953, Queen Elizabeth College. On 1 April 1980 the College was disincorporated from the University of London and reconstituted by Royal Charter as a constituent College of the University.
</p>

<p>
King's College Hospital Medical School was admitted as a School of the University in the Faculty of Medicine from 1 September 1909 and the Dental School was established in 1923. The Medical School and the College were legally reunited in September 1983. The clinical departments of the Medical School and the pre-clinical departments of the College now form the King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry. In August 1985 King's was expanded by a merger with Queen Elizabeth and Chelsea Colleges, forming a single multi-faculty School of the University. In August 1997 the Institute of Psychiatry merged with the College.
