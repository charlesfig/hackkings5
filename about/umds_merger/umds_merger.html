    <h2>King's-UMDS merger</h2>

<p>
The merger of King's and the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals (UMDS) has now been formally agreed and the legal merger date has been set for 1 August 1998. The two college Councils formally ratified the merger on 21 and 22 October 1997.
</p>

<p>
Together with the amalgamation with the Institute of Psychiatry which took effect on 1 August, the merger will confirm the new King's as a lead player in research and teaching on both the national and international stage: a multi-faculty, research-led teaching institution specialising in the 'humane sciences', with a unique suite of provision in subjects allied to medicine.  King's will remain one of the University of London's two largest colleges, with some 15,300 students, and one of the country's top five higher education institutions for research earnings.
</p>

<p>
The agreement opens the way to the relocation of the merged College's teaching and research by 2001 on three major Thames-side campuses within a single square mile of central London - at the Strand, Waterloo and the Guy's campus at London Bridge - with continuing medical and dental teaching and research at Denmark Hill and St Thomas' Hospital. New and redeveloped buildings at Waterloo and Guy's will provide state-of-the-art laboratory and teaching facilities. The £170 million merger and relocation project has been made possible by more than £40 million of Government funding - from both HEFCE and Health Service sources - and by financial support from the special trustees of Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals.
</p>

<p>
The new King's will be a research-led teaching institution of international stature specialising in the 'humane sciences':  distinctive, confident, civilising and rigorous, and independent in both intellectual and financial terms.
